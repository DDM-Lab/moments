h3 Questionnaire 3

p.bold.
  The following questions concern various reasons or motivations people might have for
  trying to respond in nonprejudiced ways. Some of the reasons reflect internal-personal
  motivations whereas others reflect more external-social motivations. Neither type of
  motivation is by definition better than the other. We are not evaluating you or your
  individual responses, we only try to get an idea of the types of motivations that people
  in general have for responding in nonprejudiced ways. It is important that you answer to
  each of the questions openly and honestly. Please give your response according to the
  scale below.
