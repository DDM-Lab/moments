2,"You are a female seminar speaker and someone says to you, “This year we had a rule that half of the seminar speakers had to be women.”"

7,"You are part of a faculty committee consisting almost entirely of older white men plus a relatively young woman with kids.

8,"You are a pregnant faculty member, and a senior colleague remarks that you are ""doing your duty for the species."""
9,"You are in a group of students who notice a poster about computer science outreach at a local school.

18,"You are a female researcher working on a manuscript with a colleague at the end of your first pregnancy.

26,"You are a single woman applying to a potential job in Pittsburgh. Someone says to you, “Pittsburgh is a great place to raise a family.”"

28,"You are a female faculty member chairing a hiring committee with all male committee members. You got behind in work when a friend was near death in the hospital.
