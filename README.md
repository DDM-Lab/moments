Moments@Work game

This is a multi-player game, written in JavaScript, run using MTurk within the DDMLab in late 2018 and/or early 2019.
Note that it long predates our use of Janus or GitHub.

To run it ensure node.js is installed and use npm to install the dependencies in `package.json`.
Then call node on `moments.js`.

It is a multiplayer game so multiple players will have to connect to it using port 3002 on whatever server it is being run on.
Players will be presented various questionaires, and then, once three are connected, game play proper will commence.
Game play consists of turning over various cards and matching them. It is similar to *Cards Against Humanity*, but
instead uses situations and responses suitable (or unsuitable) for a work enviornment.

This is at this point very old and will probably require some updating to making work again.
